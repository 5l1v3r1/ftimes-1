=item B<ExcludeFilter>: <regexp>

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<ExcludeFilter> controls are optional, and there is no predefined
limit on the number that may be specified.  However, there can be only
one B<ExcludeFilter> control/value pair per line.

Each B<ExcludeFilter> must be specified as a Perl compatible regular
expression with the caveat that no more than nine capturing '()'
subpatterns for backreferences are allowed.  Use '(?:)' if you require
parentheses for grouping purposes.

Any path matched by an B<ExcludeFilter> will be rejected.  All other
paths will be mapped subject to include filter processing.  If no
exclude filters are specified, exclude filter processing is implicitly
disabled.

Note: This control is only available if PCRE support was compiled
into the binary.
