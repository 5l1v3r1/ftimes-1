=item B<ExcludeFilter>: <regexp>

Applies to B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<mapfull>, and B<maplean>.

B<ExcludeFilter> controls are optional, and there is no predefined
limit on the number that may be specified.  However, there can be only
one B<ExcludeFilter> control/value pair per line.

Each B<ExcludeFilter> must be specified as a Perl compatible regular
expression with the exception that capturing '()' subpatterns and back
references are not allowed.  You can use '(?:)' if you require
parentheses for grouping purposes.

Any path matched by an B<ExcludeFilter> will be rejected.  All other
paths will be mapped subject to include filter processing.  If no
exclude filters are specified, exclude filter processing is implicitly
disabled.

Note: This control is only available if PCRE support was compiled
into the binary.
