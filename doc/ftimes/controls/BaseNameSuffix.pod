=item B<BaseNameSuffix>: [datetime|none|pid]

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<BaseNameSuffix> is optional.  It specifies the type of suffix
that will be attached to the B<BaseName>.  If B<BaseNameSuffix> is
set to datetime, a suffix of the following format will be appended
to the B<BaseName>: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.  If it is set to none, no suffix
will be appended, and if it is set to pid, the value of the current
process ID will be appended.  The default value is none.
