=item B<StrictControls>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, B<map>, and B<get>.

B<StrictControls> is optional.  When enabled ('Y' or 'y'), any unknown
or unsupported configuration controls will cause the program to abort.
When disabled ('N' or 'n'), any unknown or unsupported controls will
be silently ignored.  The default value is 'N'.

Note: If you want to enforce strict controls within a single config
file (or chain of config files), B<StrictControls> must be the first
control processed.  You may also enable/disable this control multiple
times.  This allows you to control the strictness of certain sections
or starting at a particular point in the entire configuration.  Once
set, this control takes effect immediately.

Note: For versions 3.8.0 and below, this control was not supported,
and the default behavior was to abort on any unknown or unsupported
configuration control.
