=item B<MapRemoteFiles>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<mapfull>, and B<maplean>.

B<MapRemoteFiles> is optional.  When enabled, (i.e. 'Y') it instructs
B<FTimes> to ignore the fact that a given B<Include> does not reside
on the local system.  The result is that B<FTimes> will attempt to
map remote files.  The default value is disabled (i.e 'N').

Note: Mapping remote file systems can create large amounts of
network traffic.  Just remember that you may be mapping an entire
disk.
