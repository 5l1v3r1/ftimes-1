=item B<ExcludeFilterKlel>: <klel-expr>

Applies to B<mad> and B<map>. Conditionally applies to B<dig>
(expressions may not utilize hash or magic attributes).

B<ExcludeFilterKlel> controls are optional, and there is no predefined
limit on the number that may be specified.  However, there can be only
one control/value pair per line.

Each include filter must be specified as a KLEL expression.  Refer
to the B<VALUE EXPRESSIONS> section of klellang(3) for details.
Information pertaining to the attributes available for use on
UNIX/WINX platforms is given in the B<IncludeFilterKlel> section
of this document.

Any object matched by a given exclude filter will be rejected.  All
other objects will be mapped subject to include filter processing.
If no exclude filters are specified, exclude filter processing is
implicitly disabled.

Note: This control is only available if KLEL filters were enabled
and KLEL support was compiled into the binary.

Note: Support for this control was added in version 3.13.0.
