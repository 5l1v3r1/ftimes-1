=item B<DigStringRegExp>: <regexp> [<tag>]

Applies to B<digauto>, B<dig>, and B<mad>.

B<DigStringRegExp> is conditionally required.  It specifies a Perl
compatible regular expression.  Unlike the strings specified in the
B<DigStringNormal> and B<DigStringNoCase> controls, this string must
not be URL encoded.  With B<DigStringRegExp> patterns, you must
specify no more than nine (9) capturing '()' subpatterns.  You can use
'(?:)' if you require additional parentheses for grouping purposes.
If you do not specify a capturing subpattern, the entire match will be
captured and used as the output value.  Otherwise, the output value is
taken from \1 -- (i.e., the first capturing subpattern).

An optional tag may specified.  Tags can be used to identify a given
dig string or set of strings -- the same tag may be assigned to
multiple strings.  This can make the process of analyzing dig output
much easier.  However, tags must not contain embedded white space, and
they must be less than 64 bytes long.

Note: This control is only available if PCRE support was compiled
into the binary.  As of version 3.5.0, PCRE support is enabled by
default.

Note: Embedded white space is not currently allowed in the regular
expression.  Use '\x20' as a substitute for a single space.
