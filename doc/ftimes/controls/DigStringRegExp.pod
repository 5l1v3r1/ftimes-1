=item B<DigStringRegExp>: <regexp>

Applies to B<digauto>, B<digfull>, and B<diglean>.

B<DigStringRegExp> is conditionally required.  It specifies a Perl
compatible regular expression.  Unlike the strings specified in the
B<DigString> and B<DigStringNoCase> controls, this string must not
be URL encoded.  With B<DigStringRegExp> patterns, you must specify
no more than one capturing '()' subpattern.  You can use '(?:)' if
you require additional parentheses for grouping purposes.  If you
do not specify a capturing subpattern, the entire match will be
captured.

Note: This control is only available if PCRE support was compiled
into the binary.  As of version 3.5.0, PCRE support is enabled by
default.
