=item B<AnalyzeMaxDps>: [0-2097152]

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<AnalyzeMaxDps> is optional.  It instructs the analysis engine to
throttle the Data Processing Speed (DPS) to the specified number of KB
per second.  This capability is useful for systems that are sensitive
to the load imposed by running this utility.  The default value is
zero, which means do not throttle the DPS.

Note: This is a best-effort control.  In other words, there is no
guarantee that the final DPS will precisely match the specified limit.

Note: This control has no influence over the priority of the executing
process.

Note: The upper limit is fixed according to following relation:
2^31/1024, which guarantees that a signed integer can represent the
maximum DPS as either KB/s or B/s.

Note: Support for this control was added in version 3.9.0.
