=item B<LogDigStrings>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<dig>, and B<mad>.

B<LogDigStrings> is optional.  When enabled ('Y' or 'y'), it instructs
B<FTimes> to record each dig string in the log file.  Preserving this
information along side the dig output is often convenient and useful,
but in some cases (e.g., searches for sensitive data), it's better to
suppress it.  The default value is 'N'.
