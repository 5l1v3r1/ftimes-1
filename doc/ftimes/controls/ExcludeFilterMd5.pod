=item B<ExcludeFilterMd5>: <regexp>

Applies to B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<ExcludeFilterMd5> controls are optional, and there is no predefined
limit on the number that may be specified.  However, there can be only
one B<ExcludeFilterMd5> control/value pair per line.

Each B<ExcludeFilterMd5> value must be specified as a Perl compatible
regular expression with the exception that capturing '()' subpatterns
and back references are not allowed.  You can use '(?:)' if you
require parentheses for grouping purposes.

Any record containing an MD5 that is matched by an B<ExcludeFilterMd5>
value will be rejected.  All other records will be written to the
output stream subject to the rules of include filter processing.  If
no filters are specified, exclude filter processing is implicitly
disabled.

Note: This control is only available if PCRE support was compiled into
the binary.

Note: This control is incompatible with the B<Compress> and
B<HashDirectories> controls.  If either of those controls are set when
attribute filtering is in play, the program will abort.

Note: Support for this control was added in version 3.9.0.
