=item B<ExcludeFilterMd5>: <pcre-expr>

Applies to B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<ExcludeFilterMd5> controls are optional, and there is no predefined
limit on the number that may be specified.  However, there can be only
one control/value pair per line.

Each exclude filter must be specified as a Perl compatible regular
expression with the caveat that no more than nine capturing '()'
subpatterns for backreferences are allowed.  Use '(?:)' if you require
parentheses for grouping purposes.

Any object matched by a given exclude filter will be rejected.  All
other objects will be mapped subject to include filter processing.
If no exclude filters are specified, exclude filter processing is
implicitly disabled.

Note: This control is only available if PCRE support was compiled into
the binary.

Note: Support for this control was added in version 3.9.0.
