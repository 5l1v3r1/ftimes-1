=item B<Exclude>: [directory|file|link]

Applies to B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<mapfull>, and B<maplean>.

B<Exclude> is optional.  It specifies a directory, file, or symbolic
link (UNIX only) to skip.  There can be as many excludes as you
like, but each entry must be on a separate line in the config file.
It is not necessary to exclude special file systems such as CDFS
or PROCFS as B<FTimes> will detect their presence and automatically
exclude them.  Each B<Exclude> must be specified as a full path.
B<FTimes> will silently ignore an B<Exclude> if it does not exist.
