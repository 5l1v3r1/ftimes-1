=item B<FieldMask>: <mask>

Applies to B<compare>, B<mapauto>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<FieldMask> is required in B<compare>.  Its value indicates what
fields are to be compared for change.

B<FieldMask> is required in B<mapauto>, B<mad>, and B<map>.
Its value dictates what attributes get collected or derived during
a scan.

There can be no embedded white space in a given mask specification,
and it must comply with the following case insensitive syntax:

    ALL[<+|-><field>...]

or

    NONE<+|-><field>[<+|-><field>...]

The following fields may be specified on WINX platforms with two
caveats:  (1) chtime is only available on Windows NT or higher and (2)
altstreams is only available if the target file system is NTFS.

    volume     - Volume serial number
    findex     - File serial number
    attributes - File attributes
    atime      - Time of last file access
    mtime      - Time of last file modification
    ctime      - Creation time
    chtime     - Change time (undocumented)
    size       - File size in bytes
    altstreams - Number of alternate or named streams
    md5        - MD5 digest of the file's data stream
    sha1       - SHA1 digest of the file's data stream
    sha256     - SHA256 digest of the file's data stream
    magic      - File type
    osid       - Owner SID
    gsid       - Group SID
    dacl       - Discretionary access control list

The following fields may be specified on UNIX platforms:

    dev        - Device identification number
    inode      - File identification number
    mode       - File attributes and permissions
    nlink      - Number of hard links
    uid        - User identification number
    gid        - Group identification number
    rdev       - Device type (contains major/minor numbers)
    atime      - Time of last file access
    mtime      - Time of last file modification
    ctime      - Time of last file status change
    size       - File size in bytes
    md5        - MD5 digest of the file's data stream
    sha1       - SHA1 digest of the file's data stream
    sha256     - SHA256 digest of the file's data stream
    magic      - File type

In addition to the standard fields, the following group fields may be
specified:

    hashes     - Compute all supported hash values
    times      - Collect all supported time values

For example, the "hashes" field is equivalent to "md5+sha1+sha256".
Similarly, the "times" field is equivalent to "atime+mtime+ctime" and
"atime+mtime+ctime+chtime" on UNIX and WINX platforms, respectively.

The "attributes" field is a collection of flags stored as a bitmap.
The breakdown for these flags is as follows:

    ------------------------
    bit  0     - 0x00001 Read Only
    bit  1     - 0x00002 Hidden
    bit  2     - 0x00004 System
    bit  3     - 0x00008 Volume Label (?)
    bit  4     - 0x00010 Directory
    bit  5     - 0x00020 Archive
    bit  6     - 0x00040 Device
    bit  7     - 0x00080 Normal
    ------------------------
    bit  8     - 0x00100 Temporary
    bit  9     - 0x00200 Sparse
    bit 10     - 0x00400 Reparse Point
    bit 11     - 0x00800 Compressed
    bit 12     - 0x01000 Offline
    bit 13     - 0x02000 Not Content Indexed
    bit 14     - 0x04000 Encrypted
    bit 15     - 0x08000 (?)
    ------------------------
    bit 16     - 0x10000 Virtual
    ------------------------

The "mode" field is a collection of flags stored as a bitmap.  The
breakdown for these flags is as follows:

    ------------------------
    bit  0     - X for other
    bit  1     - W for other
    bit  2     - R for other
    ------------------------
    bit  3     - X for group
    bit  4     - W for group
    bit  5     - R for group
    ------------------------
    bit  6     - X for owner
    bit  7     - W for owner
    bit  8     - R for owner
    ------------------------
    bit  9     - sticky bit
    bit 10     - set group ID on execution
    bit 11     - set owner ID on execution
    ------------------------
    bits 12-15 - file type
    ------------------------

To isolate the file type portion of the mode, AND the mode with octal
0170000.  The breakdown for file types is as follows:

    0010000    - named pipe (fifo)
    0020000    - character special
    0040000    - directory
    0060000    - block special
    0100000    - regular
    0120000    - symbolic link
    0140000    - socket
    0160000    - whiteout
