=item B<URLGetRequest>: [Dig{Full,Lean}Config|Map{Full,Lean}Config]

Applies to B<getmode>.

B<URLGetRequest> is required.  This control specifies what kind of
config file the client is requesting when it issues a GET request.
It also determines the next runmode when B<GetAndExec> is enabled.
Thus, values of Dig{Full,Lean}Config will cause B<FTimes> to restart
in B<digfull> or B<diglean> mode, and values of Map{Full,Lean}Config
will cause B<FTimes> to restart in B<mapfull> or B<maplean> mode.
