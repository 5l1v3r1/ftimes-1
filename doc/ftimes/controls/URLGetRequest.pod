=item B<URLGetRequest>: [DigConfig|MapConfig]

Applies to B<getmode>.

B<URLGetRequest> is required.  This control specifies what kind of
config file the client is requesting when it issues a GET request.
It also determines the next runmode when B<GetAndExec> is enabled.
Thus, a value of DigConfig will cause B<FTimes> to restart in
B<digfull>, and a value of MapConfig will cause B<FTimes> to
restart in B<mapfull>.
