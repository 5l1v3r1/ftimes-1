=item B<URLGetRequest>: [DigConfig|MapConfig]

Applies to B<get>.

B<URLGetRequest> is required.  This control specifies what kind of
config file the client is requesting when it issues a GET request.  It
also determines the next runmode when B<GetAndExec> is enabled.  Thus,
values of DigConfig will cause B<FTimes> to restart in B<dig> mode,
and values of MapConfig will cause B<FTimes> to restart in B<map>
mode.
