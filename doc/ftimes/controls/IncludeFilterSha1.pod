=item B<IncludeFilterSha1>: <regexp>

Applies to B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<IncludeFilterSha1> controls are optional, and there is no predefined
limit on the number that may be specified.  However, there can be only
one B<IncludeFilterSha1> control/value pair per line.

Each B<IncludeFilterSha1> value must be specified as a Perl compatible
regular expression with the exception that capturing '()' subpatterns
and back references are not allowed.  You can use '(?:)' if you
require parentheses for grouping purposes.

Any record containing an SHA1 that is matched by an B<IncludeFilterSha1>
value will be written to the output stream.  All other records will be
rejected.  If no filters are specified, include filter processing is
implicitly disabled.

Note: This control is only available if PCRE support was compiled into
the binary.

Note: This control is incompatible with the B<Compress> and
B<HashDirectories> controls.  If either of those controls are set when
attribute filtering is in play, the program will abort.

Note: Support for this control was added in version 3.9.0.
