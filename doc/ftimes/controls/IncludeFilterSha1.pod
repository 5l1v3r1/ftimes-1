=item B<IncludeFilterSha1>: <pcre-expr>

Applies to B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<IncludeFilterSha1> controls are optional, and there is no predefined
limit on the number that may be specified.  However, there can be only
one control/value pair per line.

Each include filter value must be specified as a Perl compatible
regular expression with the exception that capturing '()' subpatterns
and back references are not allowed.  You can use '(?:)' if you
require parentheses for grouping purposes.

Any object matched by a given include filter will be recorded in the
output stream. All other objects are implicitly excluded.  Note that
include filter processing occurs after exclude filter processing, and
once an object has been explicitly excluded, it will not be recorded
in the output stream (even if a matching include filter exists).
If no include filters are specified, include filter processing is
implicitly disabled.

Note: This control is only available if PCRE support was compiled into
the binary.

Note: Support for this control was added in version 3.9.0.
