=item B<SSLExpectedPeerCN>: <name>

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, B<map>, and B<get>.

B<SSLExpectedPeerCN> is required when B<SSLVerifyPeerCert> is
enabled.  The value of this control represents the peer's expected
Common Name (CN).  Conventionally, CNs are specified as fully
qualified domain names.  This control eliminates the need to perform
a DNS lookup at the time of certificate validation.  This, in turn,
may help to prevent attacks involving DNS spoofing.
