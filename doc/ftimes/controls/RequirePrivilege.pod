=item B<RequirePrivilege>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<RequirePrivilege> is optional.  When enabled ('Y' or 'y'), it
indicates that the operator wants to ensure that the snapshot is
run from a privileged account.  On UNIX systems this means that
B<FTimes> must be run from an account that has a real user id of
zero (i.e., root).  On NT/2K systems this means that it must be run
from an account that has the backup and restore user rights.  The
default value is 'N'.

Note: B<FTimes> will work without privilege, but it's likely to
generate more errors due to permission problems.
