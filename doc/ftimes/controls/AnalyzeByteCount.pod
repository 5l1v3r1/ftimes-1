=item B<AnalyzeByteCount>: [0-18446744073709551615]

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<AnalyzeByteCount> is optional.  It instructs the analysis engine to
stop processing once the specified amount of data (in bytes) has been
read/analyzed.  The default value for this control is zero, which
means do not impose a byte count limit.

Note: When this control is set, map mode hash values and XMagic file
types may be different from those computed during a traditional
snapshot (i.e., one where all bytes in each file are processed).
Other than the information recorded in the log file, there is no
convenient way to distinguish between traditional snapshots and those
where a byte count limit.  This could lead to unexpected compare mode
results.

Note: Support for this control was added in version 3.9.0.
