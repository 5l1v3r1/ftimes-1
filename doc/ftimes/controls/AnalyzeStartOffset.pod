=item B<AnalyzeStartOffset>: [0-18446744073709551615]

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<AnalyzeStartOffset> is optional.  It instructs the analysis engine
to seek to the specified offset (in bytes) before processing any data.
The default value for this control is zero.

Note: To map or dig through a supported block/character device file,
B<AnalyzeDeviceFiles> must be enabled and the device file must be
explicitly included on the command line or in the config file.  FTimes
refuses to read device files by default since that could result in
hung process.

Note: Device files may require you to specify an offset that is
aligned to a block boundary.  Your mileage may vary.

Note: When this control is set, map mode hash values and XMagic file
types will be different from those computed during a traditional
snapshot (i.e., one where the start offset was zero).  Other than the
information recorded in the log file, there is no convenient way to
distinguish between traditional snapshots and those where an offset
was set.  This could lead to unexpected compare mode results.

Note: Support for this control was added in version 3.9.0.
