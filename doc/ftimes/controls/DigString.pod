=item B<DigString>: <string>

Applies to B<digauto>, B<digfull>, and B<diglean>.

B<DigString> is required.  It specifies a search string.  This
string must be URL encoded if it contains '%', '+', ' ', or any
non-printable characters.  When in doubt about whether or not a
value should be encoded, encode it.  To encode a character, convert
its hex value according to the format %HH where H is a hex digit.
Spaces may alternatively be encoded as '+'.
