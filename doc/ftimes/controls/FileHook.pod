=item B<FileHook>: <klel-expression>

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<FileHook> controls are optional, and there is no predefined limit on
the number that may be specified.  However, there can be only one
B<FileHook> control/value pair per line.  Each hook must be specified
as a special type of Kl-El expression known as a guarded command.

Any path matched by a hook will cause the specified command to be
executed.  All digging/mapping operations will cease until this
command completes.

Note: This control is only available if file hooks were enabled at
compile time.
