=item B<HashDirectories>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<mapfull> and B<maplean>.

B<HashDirectories> is optional.  When enabled, (i.e. 'Y') it
instructs B<FTimes> to compute digests for directories.  This is
done by hashing the digests of all files and directories contained
in a given directory in the order they are encountered.  Thus, if
a directory has the following structure where D{1|2} and F{1|2}
represent directories and files respectively,

  D1
   |
   - F1
   + D2
      |
      - F2

then, assuming that F1 is mapped before D2, D1 and D2 have the
following hashes:

  Hash(D2) = MD5(MD5(F2))
  Hash(D1) = MD5(MD5(F1), Hash(D2))

If an entry within the directory is a special file (e.g., a device)
or cannot be opened/hashed, a 16 byte string consisting of all
zeros is used for the computation.
