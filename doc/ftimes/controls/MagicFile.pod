=item B<MagicFile>: <file>

Applies to B<mapfull> and B<maplean>.

B<MagicFile> is optional.  If the magic field in B<FieldMask> is
set and B<MagicFile> references a valid XMagic file, B<FTimes>
attempts to determine the type of each file it maps.  If the magic
field is not set, this control is ignored.  B<MagicFile> may be
specified as a relative path.  Additional information regaring XMagic
can be found here:

  http://ftimes.sourceforge.net/FTimes/XMagic.shtml

Note: XMagic is not built into B<FTimes> by default.  If your version
of B<FTimes> does not have this support and the magic field is
requested, B<FTimes> will produce null fields.

Note: XMagic is automatically disabled if compression is enabled.
