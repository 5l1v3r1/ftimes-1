=item B<DigStringNoCase>: <string> [<tag>]

Applies to B<digauto>, B<digfull>, and B<diglean>.

B<DigStringNoCase> is conditionally required.  It specifies a case
insensitive search string.  This string must be URL encoded in the
same manner as a normal dig string -- refer to the B<DigStringNormal> control
description for the details.  Internally, all alpha characters
(i.e., [A-Za-z]) are converted to lower case.

An optional tag may specified.  Tags can be used to identify a given
dig string or set of strings -- the same tag may be assigned to
multiple strings.  This can make the process of analyzing dig output
much easier.  However, tags must not contain embedded white space, and
they must be less than 64 bytes long.
