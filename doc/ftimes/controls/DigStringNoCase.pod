=item B<DigStringNoCase>: <string>

Applies to B<digauto>, B<digfull>, and B<diglean>.

B<DigStringNoCase> is conditionally required.  It specifies a case
insensitive search string.  This string must be URL encoded in the
same manner as a normal B<DigString> -- refer to that control
description for the details.  Internally, all alpha characters
(i.e., [A-Za-z]) are converted to lower case.
