=item B<BaseName>: <name>

Applies to B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<getmode>, B<mapfull>, B<maplean>, and B<putmode>.

B<BaseName> is required.  It provides prefix that will be attached
to various output files.  It also serves as the CLIENTID parameter
in GET/PUT requests. If not specified, the program will abort.

The recommended format (i.e. the format expected by C<nph-ftimes.cgi>)
for this control is CDDD_CCCC_DDDD_D where C is a character in the
range [A-Z] and D is a digit in the range [0-9].  However, you may
use any name that suits your particular requirements.  If you don't
use the recommended format, a good alternative would be the name
of the host being baselined.

If you intend to upload snapshots to an Integrity Server
configured to receive such, you will need to coordinate with the
administrator of that server to obtain the necessary access and
configuration information.
