=item B<MatchLimit>: <integer>

Applies to B<dig>, and B<mad>.

B<MatchLimit> is optional.  It instructs the search engine to stop
searching for a particular pattern within a file once the specified
match limit has been reached.  The default value is zero, which
means do not impose a limit.

Note: Searching for a string such as 'A' with a MatchLimit of zero
may produce a tremendous amount of output.
