=item B<Priority>: [low|below_normal|normal|above_normal|high]

Applies to B<compare>, B<digauto>, B<dig>, B<mad>, B<mapauto>, and
B<map>.

B<Priority> is optional.  Use it to set the priority of the running
program.  The environment variable, FTIMES_PRIORITY, trumps the value
of this control when set.  No priority is set by default.

On UNIX platforms, the priority values listed above correspond to the
following priority levels:

    low .............. 20
    below_normal ..... 10
    normal ...........  0
    above_normal .....-10
    high .............-20

On WINX platforms, the priority values listed above correspond to the
following priority classes:

    low .............. IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS
    below_normal ..... BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS
    normal ........... NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS
    above_normal ..... ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS
    high ............. HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS

Note: If the specified priority can't be set, the program will abort.

Note: If an environment variable is defined but exceeds the maximum
allowed length, it will be rejected.

Note: The priority must be set via the environment for the B<compare>
and B<mapauto> modes of operation.

Note: Support for this control was added in version 3.9.0.
