=item B<NewLine>: [LF|CRLF]

Applies to B<digfull> and B<mapfull>.

B<NewLine> is optional.  When set to the value CRLF, it generates
Windows style line feeds (i.e. carriage return and linefeed).  When
B<NewLine> is set to the value LF, it generates UNIX style line
feeds (i.e. linefeed).  This control is useful if you review/analyze
data sets from different platforms on one particular computer.
The default value for B<NewLine> is the native value for the
operating system running the program.
