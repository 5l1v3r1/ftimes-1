=item B<AnalyzeMaxDepth>: [0-65536]

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<AnalyzeMaxDepth> is optional.  It instructs the analysis engine
to stop descending a tree once the specified depth, relative to a
given B<Include> path, has been reached.  The default value is zero,
which means maximum depth enforcement is disabled.

Note: Support for this control was added in version 3.12.0.
