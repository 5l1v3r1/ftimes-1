=item B<GetAndExec>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<get>.

B<GetAndExec> is optional.  When enabled ('Y' or 'y'), it causes
B<FTimes> to start a new snapshot once the download is complete.
This is accomplished through an exec() call.  B<GetAndExec> depends
on B<GetFileName>.  The default value is 'N'.

Note: Take care when specifying B<GetFileName>.  If you choose a
location that is writeable by other processes, B<FTimes> may not
read the config file you intended it to.  That is to say, some other
process may have modified or replaced the origianl file.
