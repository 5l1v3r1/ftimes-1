=item B<URLPutSnapshot>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<URLPutSnapshot> is optional.  When enabled ('Y' or 'y'), B<FTimes>
attempts to post the snapshot to an Integrity Server.  Prior to
starting its scan, B<FTimes> will transmit an application layer
PING to the server to verify that it is accessible and functional.
If the remote CGI application is functioning properly, the extended
HTTP response code 250 (Ping Received) is returned.  B<URLPutSnapshot>
depends on B<URLPutURL>.  If basic authentication is required, the
controls B<URLUsername>, B<URLPassword>, and B<URLAuthType> may
need to be specified as well.  The default value is 'N'.
