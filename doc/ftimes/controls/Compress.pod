=item B<Compress>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<mapfull> and B<maplean>.

B<Compress> is optional.  When enabled, (i.e. 'Y') it activates a
form of lossless ASCII compression.  This yields a compression
ratio that can be as good as three to one.  The default value for
this control is disabled (i.e 'N').

As a side note, compressing compressed snapshots with a program
like gzip(1) yields better compression than if gzip(1) was used
alone on the same data in its uncompressed form.
