=item B<Compress>: [Y|N]

Applies to B<mad> and B<map>.

B<Compress> is optional.  When enabled ('Y' or 'y'), it activates
a form of lossless ASCII compression.  This yields a compression
ratio that can be as good as three to one.  The default value is
'N'.

As a side note, compressing compressed snapshots with a program
like gzip(1) yields better compression than if gzip(1) was used
alone on the same data in its uncompressed form.
