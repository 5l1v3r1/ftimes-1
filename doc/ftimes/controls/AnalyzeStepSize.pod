=item B<AnalyzeStepSize>: [1-1048576]

Applies to B<dig>, and B<mad>.

B<AnalyzeStepSize> is optional.  It instructs the analysis engine to
step through the search buffer in increments of the specified size.
Currently, this control may only be used in conjunction with the
DigStringXMagic control.  Internally, B<AnalyzeStepSize> is capped to
prevent its value from exceeding the value for B<AnalyzeBlockSize>.
The default value for this control is 32768 (32 KB).

Note: This control is only available if XMagic support was compiled
into the binary.
