=item B<IncludeFilter>: <regexp>

Applies to B<dig>, B<mad>, and B<map>.

B<IncludeFilter> controls are optional, and there is no predefined
limit on the number that may be specified.  However, there can be only
one B<IncludeFilter> control/value pair per line.

Each B<IncludeFilter> must be specified as a Perl compatible regular
expression with the caveat that no more than nine capturing '()'
subpatterns for backreferences are allowed.  Use '(?:)' if you require
parentheses for grouping purposes.

Any path matched by an B<IncludeFilter> will be mapped.  Any other
paths will be rejected.  Also note that exclude filter processing
occurs before include filter processing.  If no include filters are
specified, include filter processing is implicitly disabled.

Note: This control is only available if PCRE support was compiled
into the binary.

Warning: Due to their nature, include filters require mandatory
directory traversal.  This, in turn, will potentially alter directory
access times.  For example, suppose that you want to process all files
that end with the string: '.pdf'.  The B<IncludeFilter> would be
specified as follows:

    IncludeFilter=\.pdf$

Generally speaking, there is no way to know, apriori, where all these
files are located.  Therefore, it is necessary to traverse all
directories applying the filter to each path as it's encountered.
