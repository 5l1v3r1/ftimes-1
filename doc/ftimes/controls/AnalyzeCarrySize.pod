=item B<AnalyzeCarrySize>: [1-1048576]

Applies to B<dig>, and B<mad>.

B<AnalyzeCarrySize> is optional.  It instructs the analysis engine
to use the specified block size (in bytes) when saving (or carrying)
data from one dig operation to the next.  The default value for
this control is 1024 (1 KB).

Note: The value for this control must not exceed B<AnalyzeBlockSize>,
and it must be equal to or larger than the maximum string length
for normal and case insenstive strings.  If either condition is not
met, the program will abort.
