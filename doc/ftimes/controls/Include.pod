=item B<Include>: [directory|file|link]

Applies to B<digfull> and B<mapfull>.

B<Include> controls are optional.  There can be as many includes
as you like, but each entry must be on a separate line.  If no
B<Include> controls are specified, B<FTimes> will attempt to map
the entire system.

B<Include> values must be a regular file, directory, or symbolic
link (UNIX only) specified as a full path.  For WIN32 file systems
this control value must begin with a drive letter [a-z,A-Z] followed
by a colon and the target path (e.g., "c:\temp").  For UNIX file
systems this control value must begin with a "/" (e.g., "/tmp").

Note: You should take care not to include file systems that reside
remote shares as B<FTimes> may attempt to map them.  To prevent
this from happening, you can either exclude the remote file system
or disable B<MapRemoteFiles>.

Note: Directory hashing only applies to directories.  This means
that file includes are treated as isolated objects apart from any
specific tree.
