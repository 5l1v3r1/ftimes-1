=item B<DigStringXMagic>: <file> [<tag>]

Applies to B<digauto>, B<digfull>, and B<diglean>.

B<DigStringXMagic> is conditionally required.  It specifies the name
of a file that contains one or more XMagic incantations.  The XMagic
file may be specified as a relative path.

An optional tag may specified.  Tags can be used to identify a given
dig string or set of strings -- the same tag may be assigned to
multiple strings.  This can make the process of analyzing dig output
much easier.  However, tags must not contain embedded white space, and
they must be less than 64 bytes long.

Note: This control is only available if XMagic support was compiled
into the binary.
