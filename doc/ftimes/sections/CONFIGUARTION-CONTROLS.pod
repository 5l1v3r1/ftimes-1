=head1 CONFIGURATION CONTROLS

This section describes the various controls that B<FTimes> recognizes.
In general, controls either shape runtime behavior or provide
information needed by the application to perform a specific function.
Controls and their values, one pair/line, are written to a file
having the following format.

    <control> = <value>

All controls are case insensitive, but, in general, their values
are not.  Comments may occur anywhere on a given line, and must
begin with a pound character (i.e. '#').  In any given line, all
text to the right of the first comment will be ignored.  White
space surrounding controls and values is ignored.
