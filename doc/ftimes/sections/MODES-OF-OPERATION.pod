=head1 MODES OF OPERATION

The modes of operation described in this section are mutually
exclusive.  In other words, only one mode may be specified per
invocation.  Unless otherwise stated, the value for B<snapshot>
and B<file> arguments may be the name of a regular file or '-'.
If the latter form is given, B<FTimes> expects to read the equivalent
input from stdin.  The elements and syntax rules of for all
configuration files are described in the CONFIGURATION CONTROLS
section of this document.  The B<level> option is described in the
OPTIONS section of this document.  The B<list> option specifies
one or more directories, files, or symbolic links that are to be
scanned.  Collectively, these items represent an Include list.
See the Include control for more information.

=over 5

=item B<--cfgtest> B<file> B<mode> B<[-s]>

Verify the syntax of a given configuration B<file> in the context
of a specified B<mode> where B<mode> can be one of: B<digauto>,
B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<getmode>, B<mapfull>, B<maplean>, or
B<putmode>.  The given configuration B<file> is parsed with the
same methods that would be used if B<FTimes> had been invoked in
that particular run B<mode>.  By default, directories and files are
not checked for existence.  This allows config files to be tested
in a separate environment from where they will be used.  Strict
testing (i.e. directories and files must exist) may be enabled with
the B<-s> option.

The value 'Syntax Passed' is written to stdout, if all syntax checks
are satisfied.  Otherwise, the value 'Syntax Failed' and a description
of the failure will be written to stdout.

Note: The fact that a given file passes all syntax checks does not
guarantee that its use will lead to a successful outcome.  It merely
ensures that specified controls are valid for a given mode, and
the values for those controls meet basic syntax requirements.

=item B<--compare> B<mask> B<baseline> B<snapshot> B<[-l level]>

Compare B<baseline> and B<snapshot> data according to the specified
B<mask> where mask identifies the attributes to be analyzed.  Output
is written to stdout and has the following format.

    category|name|changed|unknown

The category field indicates what type of change has occurred.  It
can have one of the following values:

    C - Changed
    M - Missing
    N - New
    U - Unknown (i.e. one or both fields were NULL)
    X - Cross (i.e. Changed and Unknown)

The changed field contains a comma separated list of fields that
have changed.  This field will be NULL if the category is New or
Missing.

The unknown field contains a comma separated list of fields that
could not be compared due to lack of information.  This field will
be NULL if the category is New or Missing.

The specified B<mask> must comply with the syntax rules set forth
for the B<FieldMask> control.

=item B<--decoder> B<snapshot> B<[-l level]>

Decode a compressed B<snapshot>.  A compressed snapshot can be
created by running B<FTimes> in map mode (i.e. B<mapfull> or
B<maplean>) with B<Compress> enabled.  Output is written to stdout.

=item B<--digauto> B<file> B<[-l level]> B<[list]>

Use default configuration settings to search an Include list for
a set of user defined strings.  These strings are defined in B<file>
according to the syntax for the B<DigString> control.  If B<list>
is not specified, B<FTimes> will search the entire system including
remote shares or mount points.  Output is written to stdout and
has the following format.

    name|offset|string

The offset field, represented as a decimal value, contains the
location in the file identified by name where the specified string
was found.

=item B<--digfull> B<file> B<[-l level]> B<[list]>

Use the configuration settings in B<file> to search an Include list
for a set of user defined strings.  The Include list may be specified
by a combination of B<Include> controls and B<list> arguments.  If
an Include list is not specified, B<FTimes> will search the entire
system.  Remote shares or mount points will only be searched if
B<MapRemoteFiles> is enabled.

=item B<--diglean> B<file> B<[-l level]> B<[list]>

Use the configuration settings in B<file> to search an Include list
for a set of user defined strings.  The Include list may be specified
by a combination of B<Include> controls and B<list> arguments.  If
an Include list is not specified, B<FTimes> will search the entire
system.  Remote shares or mount points will only be searched if
B<MapRemoteFiles> is enabled.  The difference between this mode and
B<--digfull> is that fewer controls are defined/available and output
can be written directly to std{err,out}.

=item B<--getmode> B<file>

Use the configuration settings in B<file> to download digfull,
diglean, mapfull, or maplean configuration information.  One of
three possible actions, depending on how getmode is configured,
will take place once the download is complete:

=over 5

=item *

B<FTimes> writes the downloaded information to stdout,

=item *

B<FTimes> writes the downloaded information to the file specified by B<GetFileName>, or

=item *

B<FTimes> restarts in B<digfull>, B<diglean>, B<mapfull>, or B<maplean> using the downloaded information as it's new configuration file

=back

The first action is effected when B<GetAndExec> is disabled and
B<GetFileName> is not specified.  The second action is effected
when B<GetAndExec> is disabled and B<GetFileName> is specified.
The third action is effected when B<GetAndExec> is enabled and
B<GetFileName> is specified.

=item B<--mapauto> B<mask> B<[-l level]> B<[list]>

Use default configuration settings to map an Include list according
to the specified B<mask> where mask identifies the attributes to
be collected.  If B<list> is not specified, B<FTimes> will map the
entire system including remote shares or mount points.  Output is
written to stdout, and its format depends on the value of B<mask>.

The specified B<mask> must comply with the syntax rules set forth
for the B<FieldMask> control.

=item B<--mapfull> B<file> B<[-l level]> B<[list]>

Use configuration settings in B<file> to map an Include list.  The
Include list may be specified by a combination of B<Include> controls
and B<list> arguments.  If an Include list is not specified,
B<FTimes> will map the entire system.  Remote shares or mount points
will only be mapped if B<MapRemoteFiles> is enabled.

=item B<--maplean> B<file> B<[-l level]> B<[list]>

Use configuration settings in B<file> to map an Include list.  The
Include list may be specified by a combination of B<Include> controls
and B<list> arguments.  If an Include list is not specified, B<FTimes>
will map the entire system.  Remote shares or mount points will
only be mapped if B<MapRemoteFiles> is enabled.  The difference
between this mode and B<--mapfull> is that fewer controls are
defined/available and output can be written directly to std{err,out}.

=item B<--putmode> B<file> B<[-l level]>

Use the configuration settings in B<file> to upload an existing
snapshot to an Integrity Server configured to receive such.

=item B<--version>

Display version information and exit.
