=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Example 1. Standard operation

This example demonstrates how to create a cross-platform archive of a
file with a neutered name.  In this case, the name contains space and
newline characters.

    ftimes-xpa --archive -- name+with+spaces%0aand%0anewlines > out.xpa

Such a file can be created with the following Perl one-liner:

    perl -e 'open(F, ">name with spaces\nand\nnewlines"); print F "jinx\n";'

=head2 Example 2. Standard operation with input from stdin

This example demonstrates how to create a cross-platform archive from
a list of files passed on stdin.  The list for stdin will be generated
by ftimes(1).

    ftimes --mapauto none -l 6 *.o | ftimes-xpa --archive --list - > out.xpa

=head2 Example 3. Files with alternate data streams

This example demonstrates how to create a cross-platform archive of an
alternate data stream called 'ads1'.

    ftimes-xpa --archive -- some-file-with-a-stream:ads1

If you believe a file contains an alternate data stream, you can use
ftimes(1) to determine its name as follows:

    ftimes --mapauto none -l 6 some-file-with-a-stream

Note that alternate data streams are specific to WINX platforms and
NTFS.
