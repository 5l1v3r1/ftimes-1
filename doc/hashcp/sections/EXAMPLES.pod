=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Example 1. Standard hash and copy operation

This example demonstrates how to hash a file called 'out' (in the
current directory) and copy it to '/tmp/out'.

    hashcp out /tmp/out

=head2 Example 2. Hash and copy with input from echo(1)

This example demonstrates how to hash stdin and copy it to a file
called 'out.echo'.  The data for stdin will be generated by the
echo(1) command.

    echo "This is a test." | hashcp - out.echo

=head2 Example 3. Hash and copy with input from dd(1)

This example demonstrates how to hash stdin and copy it to a file
called 'out.zero'.  The data for stdin will be generated by the dd(1)
command reading from /dev/zero.

    dd if=/dev/zero bs=32k count=1 | hashcp - out.zero
