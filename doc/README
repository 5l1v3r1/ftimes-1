2 General

  Building the project's documentation is now done at build time.
  Because of this, your build process may fail if your system does not
  have current versions of Perl (e.g., 5.8.7 or higher), pod2man, and
  pod2html installed.

  If necessary, you can disable document builds by modifying the
  project's root-level Makefile (i.e., Makefile.in).  Simply remove
  the "doc" entry from the SUBDIRS variable.
