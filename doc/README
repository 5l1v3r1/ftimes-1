2 Overview
 
  In general, you don't need to build the documentation because it
  will be provided in the distribution.  However, in the event that
  you do, you should know that the original version of Html.pm was
  modified by the developer.  If you care about this and wish to
  build the documentation the way it was intended, follow the
  instructions in section 3.

3 Patching Html.pm

  Before patching Html.pm, you should figure out where Html.pm
  lives on your system and check to see that its MD5 matches the
  one provided here:

    MD5 = 5f16c14462cfba6cdc1735236ecd5ea6

  If you want to patch Html.pm by hand, do the following:

    - Remove the LINK tag code.  Search for LINK.

    - Add an if block around the index code.  Search for INDEX.

      if ($doindex) { <existing code> }

    - Add https to the list of urls.  Search for "my $urls".

    - Remove paragraph tag from process_head().

    - Balance paragraph tags in pod2html() (i.e. add </P>).

  If you want to patch Html.pm with patch, do the following:

    - Create a file named Html.pm.patch that contains the patch
      provided at the end of this document.  Be sure to copy the
      patch exactly as it contains a mixture of spaces and tabs.

    - Run the following command:

      patch < Html.pm.patch
