=head1 HISTORY

This utility was initially written to help determine if any files on a
system with no prior baseline had been changed.  While the system in
question didn't have a baseline, it did have several tar ball backups.
The main issue was that the backups were so large that extracting them
to temporary storage first would have been impractical.  This utility,
allowed us to avoid that issue by directly processing an uncompressed
stream of the backup (e.g., via gunzip or bunzip2).

This utility first appeared in B<FTimes> 3.8.0.
