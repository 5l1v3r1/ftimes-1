=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Example 1. Standard operation

This example demonstrates how to cat a file with a neutered name.  In
this case, the name contains space and newline characters.

    ftimes-cat name+with+spaces%0aand%0anewlines

Such a file can be created with the following Perl one-liner:

    perl -e 'open(F, ">name with spaces\nand\nnewlines"); print F "jinx\n";'

=head2 Example 2. Standard operation with input from stdin

This example demonstrates how to copy stdin to a file called
'out.zero'.  The data for stdin will be generated by the dd(1) command
reading from /dev/zero.

    dd if=/dev/zero bs=32k count=1 | ftimes-cat - > out.zero

=head2 Example 3. Files with alternate data streams

This example demonstrates how to cat the contents of an alternate data
stream called 'ads1'.

    ftimes-cat some-file-with-a-stream:ads1

If you believe a file contains an alternate data stream, you can use
ftimes(1) to determine its name as follows:

    ftimes --mapauto none -l 6 some-file-with-a-stream

Note that alternate data streams are specific to WINX platforms and
NTFS.
