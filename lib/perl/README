NAME

  ftimes-lib-perl

OVERVIEW

  This library is a collection of modules designed to support various
  FTimes utilities.  Minimal effort was put into supporting this code
  for general consumption.  In other words, use at your own risk and
  don't expect the interface to remain the same or backwards
  compatible from release to release.  The modules in this library do
  not provide an OO interface.  That could change in time, but for
  now, that's the way it is.

INSTALLATION

  To install the modules in this library (the Perl way), run the
  following commands:

  UNIX-based platforms:

    perl config (only if Makefile.PL is missing)
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

  Windows-based platforms (equipped with ActivePerl):

    perl config (only if Makefile.PL is missing)
    perl Makefile.PL
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install

  If you want to build/install this library as part of a regular
  FTimes release, follow the instructions in README.INSTALL, which is
  located in the project's root directory.

DEPENDENCIES

  This library requires Perl 5.8.0 or higher.

LICENSE

  All documentation and code are distributed under same terms and
  conditions as FTimes.
