1 Overview

  FTimes is a forensic system baselining, searching, and evidence
  collection tool.  The primary purpose of FTimes is to gather
  and/or develop topographical information and attributes about
  specified directories and files in a manner conducive to intrusion
  and forensic analysis.  FTimes is available from these locations:

    https://git.korelogic.com/ftimes.git
    https://github.com/KoreLogicSecurity/ftimes
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/ftimes

2 Licensing

  This project is governed by multiple licences. The exact terms and
  conditions under which the software in this project are released
  are set forth in README.LICENSE.

3 Versions

  This project utilizes a version numbering scheme that allocates
  4 bits to the major number, 8 bits to the minor number, 8 bits
  to the patch number, 2 bits to the state number, and 10 bits to
  the build number. The following diagram depicts the scheme.

    +----+--------+--------+--+----------+
    |3322|22222222|11111111|11|          |
    |1098|76543210|98765432|10|9876543210|

        |        |       |   |          +-----> b - build (0...1023)
        |        |       |   +----------------> s - state (0......3)
        |        |       +--------------------> p - patch (0....255)
        |        +----------------------------> m - minor (0....255)
        +-------------------------------------> M - major (0.....15)

  State Numbers:

    00 = ds --> Development Snapshot
    01 = rc --> Release Candidate
    10 = sr --> Standard Release
    11 = xs --> eXtended Snapshot

4 Branches

  This project is mastered in three branches: master, 3.X, and 4.X.
  Currently, there are no plans for development on the master and
  3.X branches.  The master branch exists due to the way that git
  works; the 3.X branch exists to hold snapshots of legacy releases;
  and the 4.X branch exists to track future development activities.

  Below is a diagram that illustrates how the code repository may
  take shape over time.  Note that snapshot tags are tightly coupled
  to the project's version numbering scheme (documented above).
  These tags are used to designate official branch points and stable
  locations in the codebase.  The standard snapshot designator is
  'S', but 'R' is used to indicate a release snapshot.
