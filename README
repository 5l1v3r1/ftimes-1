2 Documentation

  General documentation is located in the doc directory.  This is
  where the man page lives -- i.e., ftimes.html.  The file README.INSTALL
  explains how to build FTimes, configure an Apache Web server to
  handle FTimes requests, and perform basic client-server functionality
  tests.

  The paper, "System Baselining -- A Forensic Perspective", defines
  baselining terminology, explains the mechanics of baselining,
  compares and contrasts different baselining techniques, and
  describes FTimes.  It also explores some of the criteria that
  evidence collection tools and techniques must satisfy if they are
  going to support prosecutions.  In closing, it presents a pair
  of war stories that are typical of the times.  This paper, written
  in LaTeX, is called baselining.tex and is located in doc/baselining.
